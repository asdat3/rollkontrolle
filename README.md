# RollKontrolle
 RolladenSteuerung

Ja ka viel spaÃŸ

Usage
=====

Python3
- clone
- install all missing modules via pip or anything (I got no requirements since I didnt make a venv for this repo sorry)
- configure `config.json`
- should be self explaining xD else open a issue or smt. I doubt anyone is interested in this

ToDo
=====

- Make current thing host and communicate with other raspi's to control multiple Rolladen via one Interface
- auto updater so it can be deployed at nobrainer locations
- login anti bruteforce > general ban system
- actually make contact thing work
